### Methodology
It’s a work in teams, it’s important to discuss and make decisions with all members of the team for the common parts. The website should have a consistent appearance. One important part of this work is the code sharing and communication between members. Define together how to share your code in the team (OneDrive, …) and how to communicate among yourselves. Also think about how the integration of code will be done. Reminder of the methodology to create a website:

### Menu
#### Main Courses:

- Coq au Vin: A classic French dish, where chicken is braised with wine, lardons, mushrooms, and possibly garlic. A dish that sings with depth and warmth, perfect for a cozy yet sophisticated dinner.

- Beef Bourguignon: This French stew marries beef with red wine, onions, and mushrooms, slow-cooked to tender perfection. It's a symphony of flavors that speaks of the French countryside.

- Risotto ai Funghi Porcini: An Italian masterpiece, this risotto is creamy, earthy, and rich, infused with the distinct aroma of Porcini mushrooms and a generous helping of Parmigiano-Reggiano.

- Saltimbocca alla Romana: Thin veal cutlets, layered with sage and prosciutto, cooked in white wine and butter. A dish that literally means "jumps in the mouth" in Italian - an experience you won't forget.

- Bouillabaisse: A fragrant and hearty French seafood stew, brimming with fish, shellfish, and herbs. It's like a gentle sea breeze on a warm summer evening in Marseille.

#### Side Dishes:

- Ratatouille: A vibrant French vegetable stew, combining eggplant, zucchini, bell peppers, and tomatoes, gently simmered with herbs. A colorful ode to Provence.

- Polenta con Tartufo Nero: Creamy polenta, infused with the luxurious aroma of black truffles. A dish that's both humble and opulent, much like Italy itself.

#### Desserts:

- Tiramisu: A quintessential Italian dessert, layering coffee-soaked ladyfingers with a luscious blend of mascarpone cheese, eggs, and sugar. A sweet embrace in every bite.

- Crème Brûlée: A silky French custard, crowned with a caramelized sugar crust. It's simplicity and elegance in a ramekin.

#### Drinks:
- Chianti Classico: A robust Italian red wine, perfect to accompany the risotto or saltimbocca
- Champagne: No French-themed menu is complete without a glass of sparkling Champagne. Its effervescence and crisp taste make it a delightful pairing with both appetizers and desserts.

- Negroni: An iconic Italian cocktail, blending gin, Campari, and sweet vermouth. Its bittersweet complexity is a perfect palate cleanser between courses or a sophisticated conclusion to the meal.
