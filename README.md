### Methodology
It’s a work in teams, it’s important to discuss and make decisions with all members of the team for the common parts. The website should have a consistent appearance. One important part of this work is the code sharing and communication between members. Define together how to share your code in the team (OneDrive, …) and how to communicate among yourselves. Also think about how the integration of code will be done. Reminder of the methodology to create a website:
